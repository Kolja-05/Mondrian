## Indruduction
Piet Mondrian was a Dutch painter, art theoretician, and a pioneer of 20th-century abstract art. Coming from an Impressionist art style, Mondrian evolved, and since the 1920s he created his famous geometric paintings, which follow the ideas of his art-theoretical essay "Le Neoplasticism", in which he wrote:

"As a pure representation of the human mind, art will express itself in an aesthetically purified—that is to say, abstract—form. The new plastic idea cannot, therefore, take the form of a natural or concrete representation. This new plastic 
idea will ignore the particulars of appearance—that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of natural form and colour—that is to say, the straight line and the clearly defined
primary colours" (red, blue, and yellow).
